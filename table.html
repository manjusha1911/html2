<p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>5</td>/tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr>
</table>
